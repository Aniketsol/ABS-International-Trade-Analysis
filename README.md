# 📊 Visual Analytics: Australian International Trade (1988–2023)
**An in-depth analysis of trade patterns and machinery import dependencies using ABS data.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a visual analysis of the **Australian International Trade Dataset** sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Covering data from 1988 to 2023, the analysis investigates 10 main categories and 67 sub-categories of trade. The primary focus is on the **Machinery and Transport Equipment** sector to identify economic patterns and dependencies.

## 🔍 Key Findings
* **Import Dependency:** Analysis shows a significant reliance on imports for infrastructure and automotive needs.
* **High-Demand Sectors:** The most critical subcategories identified are **Road Vehicles (78)** and **Electrical Machinery (77)**
* **Trade Imbalance:** Imports consistently outpace exports in the machinery category, reflecting limited local manufacturing capacity.
* **Economic Impact:** The data visualizes trade fluctuations caused by the **2008 Global Financial Crisis** and the **COVID-19 Pandemic**, followed by a sharp post-pandemic recovery.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology
* **Software:** Tableau Desktop used for creating interactive Dashboards and a Narrative Storyboard.
* **Data Source:** Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
* **Metrics:** Trade prices recorded in Australian dollars to track trends over time.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
* **Invest in Domestic Manufacturing:** Develop local production capabilities for high-demand goods like road vehicles and electrical machinery.
* **Policy Support:** Encourage local manufacturing through policy incentives, trade protections, or international partnerships.
* **Enhance Export Capacity:** Strengthen export activities in machinery subcategories to shift Australia toward a more balanced, export-driven model.
