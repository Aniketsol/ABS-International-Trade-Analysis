Visual Analytics: Australian International Trade (1988–2023)
Project Overview
This project presents a visual analysis of the Australian International Trade Dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Covering data from 1988 to 2023, the analysis focuses on identifying trade patterns, dependencies, and economic trends, with a specific emphasis on the Machinery and Transport Equipment sector.

Key Objectives
Analyze trade prices in Australian dollars across 10 main categories and 67 sub-categories.

Identify significant import dependencies that impact domestic manufacturing.

Visualize the impact of major global economic events on trade volumes.

Major Findings

Import Dependency: The analysis reveals a heavy reliance on foreign markets, particularly for essential machinery and automotive goods.


High-Demand Sectors: Road Vehicles (Subcategory 78) and Electrical Machinery (Subcategory 77) are identified as the most significant areas of import demand.


Trade Imbalance: Imports consistently outpace exports in the machinery sector, highlighting a gap in local manufacturing capacity.


Economic Resilience: The data visualizes the sharp trade fluctuations caused by the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by rapid recovery in specific sectors.

Recommendations

Domestic Investment: Expand local production capabilities for high-demand goods like electrical machinery to reduce foreign dependency.


Policy Support: Implement incentives or trade protections to foster partnerships with international manufacturers.


Export Strategy: Shift the trade profile by strengthening export activities in specialized machinery subcategories.

Methodology & Tools

Data Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).


Visualization Tool: Tableau (including Dashboards and a Narrative Storyboard).


Focus Area: Machinery and Transport Equipment.
