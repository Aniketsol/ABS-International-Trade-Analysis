📊 Visual Analytics: Australian International Trade (1988–2023)

An in-depth analysis of Australia’s international trade patterns and machinery import dependencies using ABS data.

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the Australian International Trade Dataset from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), covering over three decades of import and export operations. The focus is on the Machinery and Transport Equipment sector to identify economic vulnerabilities and opportunities for growth.

🔍 Key Findings

Import Dependency: Australia relies heavily on international markets for infrastructure and automotive needs.

High-Demand Sectors: The critical subcategories are Road Vehicles (78) and Electrical Machinery (77).

Trade Imbalance: Imports consistently exceed exports in machinery, reflecting limited local manufacturing capacity.

Economic Impact: Trade volume fluctuations reflect events such as the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic, followed by a sharp post-pandemic recovery.

🛠️ Tools & Methodology

Software: Tableau Desktop (Dashboards & Narrative Storyboarding)

Data Source: Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)

Scope: 10 main categories and 67 detailed sub-categories

🚀 Strategic Recommendations

Domestic Investment: Develop local production capabilities for high-demand machinery and road vehicles to reduce foreign reliance.

Policy Support: Encourage local manufacturing through trade protections, incentives, or international partnerships.

Export Strategy: Strengthen specialized machinery exports to move toward a more balanced, export-driven economic model.
