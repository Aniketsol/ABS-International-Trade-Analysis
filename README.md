📊 Visual Analytics: Australian International Trade (1988–2023)
An analysis of trade patterns and dependencies to strengthen domestic manufacturing.

🔍 Executive Summary
This project analyzes 35 years of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data. By examining 10 main categories and 67 sub-categories, the study uncovers Australia's significant reliance on international imports, particularly within the Machinery and Transport Equipment sector.

Primary Drivers: Road Vehicles (Subcategory 78) and Electrical Machinery (Subcategory 77) are the highest-demand sectors.


Trade Imbalance: Imports consistently outpace exports in these categories, reflecting a gap in local manufacturing capacity.


Economic Impact: The data highlights sharp fluctuations and recoveries surrounding the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic.

🛠 Tools & Methodology
