📊 Australian International Trade Analytics (1988–2023)
Project Overview

This project explores Australia’s international trade patterns over three decades using ABS data, focusing on the Machinery and Transport Equipment sector. The analysis identifies import dependencies, high-demand subcategories, and trade imbalances, providing insights into economic vulnerabilities and growth opportunities.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and strategic insight, making it ideal for Data Analyst or Business Intelligence roles.

Analysis & Methodology

Data Collection:

Source historical import/export data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

Cover 10 main categories and 67 sub-categories.

Data Processing & Cleaning:

Organize data for time-series analysis (1988–2023).

Standardize category codes and merge related tables.

Handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Visualization & Analytics:

Build Tableau dashboards for trend analysis, sector comparison, and trade volume visualization.

Highlight critical subcategories: Road Vehicles (78) and Electrical Machinery (77).

Examine trade fluctuations during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, followed by post-pandemic recovery.

Insights Extraction:

Identify key import dependencies.

Quantify trade imbalances and their economic implications.

Provide actionable recommendations for investment, policy, and export strategies.

Key Findings

Import Dependency: Heavy reliance on international markets for infrastructure and automotive needs.

High-Demand Sectors: Road Vehicles and Electrical Machinery are the most critical subcategories.

Trade Imbalance: Imports consistently exceed exports in machinery, reflecting limited local manufacturing capacity.

Economic Impact: Trade volumes fluctuate during global crises, with sharp post-pandemic recovery observed.

Strategic Recommendations

Domestic Investment: Develop local production capabilities for high-demand machinery and vehicles to reduce foreign reliance.

Policy Support: Promote local manufacturing through incentives, trade protections, or international partnerships.

Export Strategy: Strengthen specialized machinery exports to shift toward a balanced, export-driven economy.

Tools & Technologies

Software: Tableau Desktop (Dashboards & Narrative Storyboarding)
