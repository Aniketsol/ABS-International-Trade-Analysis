# 📊 Australian International Trade Analytics (1988–2023)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end analysis of Australia’s international trade** using **`ABS` data**. It covers trade patterns over three decades, focusing on the **`Machinery and Transport Equipment` sector**, and identifies **import dependencies, high-demand subcategories, and trade imbalances**.

The project showcases practical skills in **data analysis, visualization, and insights generation**, making it ideal for **`Data Analyst` or `Business Intelligence` roles**.

## Analysis & Methodology

**Data Collection (Bronze Layer – Raw Data):**
- Gather historical import/export data from **`Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)`**.
- Include **10 main categories and 67 sub-categories**.
- Load raw data into **staging tables** for processing.

**Data Cleaning & Transformation (Silver Layer – Processed Data):**
- Standardize **category codes** and merge related tables.
- Handle **missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates**.
- Prepare data for **time-series analysis (`1988–2023`)**.

**Analytics & Visualization (Gold Layer – Insights-Ready):**
- Create **`Tableau dashboards`** for **trend analysis, sector comparison, and trade volume visualization**.
- Highlight critical subcategories: **`Road Vehicles (78)`** and **`Electrical Machinery (77)`**.
- Analyze trade fluctuations during **`2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC)`** and **`COVID-19 pandemic`**, followed by **post-pandemic recovery**.

**Insights Extraction & Recommendations:**
- Identify **key import dependencies**.
- Quantify **trade imbalances** and their **economic impact**.
- Recommend strategies for **domestic investment, policy support, and export optimization**.

## Key Findings

- **Import Dependency:** Heavy reliance on international markets for **`infrastructure`** and **`automotive needs`**.
- **High-Demand Sectors:** **`Road Vehicles`** and **`Electrical Machinery`** are the most critical subcategories.
- **Trade Imbalance:** Imports consistently exceed exports in machinery, reflecting **limited local manufacturing capacity**.
- **Economic Impact:** Trade volumes fluctuate during global crises, with **sharp post-pandemic recovery** observed.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Domestic Investment:** Develop **local production capabilities** for **high-demand machinery** and **vehicles** to reduce foreign reliance.
- **Policy Support:** Promote **local manufacturing** through **incentives, trade protections, or international partnerships**.
- **Export Strategy:** Strengthen **specialized machinery exports** to move toward a **balanced, export-driven economy**.
