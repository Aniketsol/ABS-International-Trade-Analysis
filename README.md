# 📊 Visual Analytics: Australian International Trade (1988–2023)
**An in-depth analysis of trade patterns and machinery import dependencies using ABS data, presented through a narrative storytelling approach.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a visual analysis of the **Australian International Trade Dataset** sourced from the **Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)**. Covering data from 1988 to 2023, the analysis investigates **10 main categories and 67 sub-categories** of trade. The primary focus is on the **Machinery and Transport Equipment** sector to identify economic patterns and dependencies.

A key part of this project is **storytelling** using Tableau's **Narrative Storyboard**, which guides viewers through trade trends, sector dependencies, and economic events over time.

## 🔍 Key Findings
* **Import Dependency:** Analysis shows a significant reliance on imports for infrastructure and automotive needs.
* **High-Demand Sectors:** The most critical subcategories identified are **Road Vehicles (78)** and **Electrical Machinery (77)**.
* **Trade Imbalance:** Imports consistently outpace exports in the machinery category, reflecting **limited local manufacturing capacity**.
* **Economic Impact:** The data visualizes trade fluctuations caused by the **2008 Global Financial Crisis** and the **COVID-19 Pandemic**, followed by a sharp **post-pandemic recovery**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology
* **Software:** Tableau Desktop used for creating **interactive Dashboards** and a **Narrative Storyboard** to present the data as a cohesive story.
* **Data Source:** Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
* **Metrics:** Trade prices recorded in Australian dollars to track trends over time.
* **Approach:** Data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization designed to highlight **key patterns, dependencies, and economic insights**.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
* **Invest in Domestic Manufacturing:** Develop local production capabilities for high-demand goods like road vehicles and electrical machinery.
* **Policy Support:** Encourage local manufacturing through **policy incentives, trade protections, or international partnerships**.
* **Enhance Export Capacity:** Strengthen export activities in machinery subcategories to shift Australia toward a more **balanced, export-driven model**.
